# Notes

Most items in dokuly either have a **Notes** tab in its dashboard, or a similar **Notes** card for creating a description (e.g. *Revision notes* or *Errata* on part items). The main notes for an item, is found under the **Notes** tab. Here, you have a *Main notes* tab selected as default.

To view how the markdown will be rendered, click on the **Show Split View** button. This shows you the preview of your markdown while editing.
