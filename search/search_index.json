Use the following credentials to log in for the first time: Username: ossuser Password: oss_password You can now start using and configuring Dokuly for your use case. Configure self hosting of Dokuly To start hosting the service on your own machine you have to have all dependencies installed. This includes docker and node. See the table of contents for more information on installing these dependencies. Nginx proxy Local Hosting Setup Guide To enable access to your locally hosted project on your local network or VPN, follow these steps to configure an NGINX proxy. Directly using your machine's local IP address might not suffice, hence the need for these adjustments: Locate the NGINX Configuration: Navigate to the nginx folder where crucial configuration files reside. Edit the Configuration File: Within the nginx folder, find and open the nginx.conf file for editing: Update IP Address: Search for a line starting with server_name , typically containing an IP like 10.0.0.21 . Replace it with your machine's local network IP. To find your IP address: On Linux/Mac: Open a terminal and enter: ifconfig On Windows: Open Command Prompt and type: ipconfig Look for the IPv4 address under your network connection, usually formatted as 192.168.x.x . Set Project Name: Locate the line proxy_set_header Host and change the adjacent value to your project's name. If you haven't set up a project name, run the self_host_create_new_tenant script. Save and Close: After making the necessary edits, save the changes and close the nginx.conf file. Restart NGINX: To apply your changes, execute the self_host_restart.ps1 script located in the self_hosting folder. By following these steps, your locally hosted project should become accessible to others on the same network or VPN using your computer's local IP address. SMTP Email Dokuly has support for smtp email, and some basic functions via email like resetting your user's password. To setup the smtp you will need your own smtp server setup, and then in the .env file add the following fields: EMAIL_HOST = \"your_smtp_provider_address\" EMAIL_PORT = your_port EMAIL_HOST_USER = \"your_smtp_username\" EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = \"your_smtp_password\" EMAIL_SENDER = 'your_smtp_sender_address' Replace the values with your own information from your smtp provider.","title":"Self-hosting"},{"location":"quickstart/#quickstart","text":"Make sure docker and other dependencies are installed.
